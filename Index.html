<h1>Snail Mail</h1>
<h2>The Premier Escargot Delivery Service</h2>
<h3>What is Escargot?</h3>
<p>Escargot, means "edible snail", seems to date from 1892 and is a cooked land snail. Not all species of land snail are edible, and many are too small to make it worthwhile to prepare and cook them. Even among the edible species, the palatability of the flesh varies from species to species. In France, the species "Helix pomatia" is most often eaten.
</p>
<h3>How is it prepared?</h3>
<p>In French cuisine, the snails are typically purged, killed, removed from their shells, and cooked (usually with garlic butter, chicken soup or wine), and then placed back into the shells with the butter and sauce for serving. Additional ingredients may be added, such as garlic, thyme, parsley and pine nuts. Special snail tongs (for holding the shell) and snail forks (for extracting the meat) are also normally provided, and they are served on indented metal trays with places for six or 12 snails.
